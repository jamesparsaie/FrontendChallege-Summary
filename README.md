## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As I continue to work through these challenge projects offered by Frontend Mentor, I have gained invaulable experience in desiging objects based on inspiration from scratch. Specifically in the area of mobile first development, I have learned the value and skills to address responsiveness in webpages
and ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience for users who are navigating a webpage

Some cool things I learned
  - I learned a very interesting way to make a div that represents a perfect circle to represent data (see the score div on the webpage)
```css
.circleScore {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    width: 7vw;
    height: 7vw;
    border-radius:50%;
    margin-top: 8%;
    background-color: #452cdd;
    background: linear-gradient(#5025ce, #5534e1, #523def)
}
```
 - Additionally, I gained experience further in developing mobile based viewing via the @media tag in CSS

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {

}
```

### Continued development
